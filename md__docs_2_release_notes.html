<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md44"></a>
Unreleased Changes</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md45"></a>
New functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added new define <code>JPH_TRACK_SIMULATION_STATS</code> which tracks simulation statistics on a per body basis. This can be used to figure out bodies are the most expensive to simulate.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_ragdoll_settings.html#a2abfef1ce2210e7459fb5c412ed94b21">RagdollSettings::CalculateConstraintPriorities</a></code> which calculates constraint priorities that boost the priority of joints towards the root of the ragdoll.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>A 6DOF constraint that constrains all rotation axis in combination with a body that has some of its rotation axis locked would not constrain the rotation in the unlocked axis.</li>
<li>Added include <code>type_traits</code> for <code>std::is_trivial</code> to avoid compile error on macOS with clang 21.</li>
<li>Fixed compilation error when using Jolt in conjunction with the <code>_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC</code> define on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed cast shape possibly not returning a hit when a shape cast starts touching (but not intersecting) another shape and requesting the deepest hit.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
v5.4.0</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
New functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added Cosserat rods to soft bodies. This is a stick constraint with an orientation that can be used to attach geometry. Can be used e.g. to simulate vegetation in a cheap way. See the new <code>SoftBodyCosseratRodConstraintTest</code> demo.</li>
<li>Added ability to drive hinge constraints with <code><a class="el" href="class_ragdoll.html#a367f16f5385eb377e5419d12457c22c6" title="Drive the ragdoll to a specific pose by activating the motors on each constraint.">Ragdoll::DriveToPoseUsingMotors</a></code>. This also adds <code><a class="el" href="class_hinge_constraint.html#ab9cae9664c957de813baeb21a13d3686">HingeConstraint::SetTargetOrientationBS</a></code> which sets the target angle in body space.</li>
<li>Added <code>JPH_USE_EXTERNAL_PROFILE</code> cmake option that allows overriding the behavior of the profile macros.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_soft_body_creation_settings.html#a284bce9885936d4b57243e57e00c8747" title="If the faces in this soft body should be treated as double sided for the purpose of collision detecti...">SoftBodyCreationSettings::mFacesDoubleSided</a></code> which treats the faces of the soft body as double sided. This can be used to make e.g. flags double sided.</li>
<li>Added functions to get the <code><a class="el" href="class_character_settings.html" title="Contains the configuration of a character.">CharacterSettings</a></code> from a <code><a class="el" href="class_character.html">Character</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual_settings.html" title="Contains the configuration of a character.">CharacterVirtualSettings</a></code> from a <code><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a></code>.</li>
<li>Added support for compound shapes as character shape in <code><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a></code>.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_body_interface.html#a194ead0d415804369dbaf9ef9ecc3dbf">BodyInterface::SetIsSensor</a></code>/<code>IsSensor</code> functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in <code>ManifoldBetweenTwoFaces</code> which would not find the correct manifold in case face 1 had 3 or more vertices and face 2 only 2. E.g. for a box resting the long edge of a cylinder this would mean that only a single contact point was found instead of 2 (the other way around would work fine).</li>
<li>Fixed bug in <code><a class="el" href="class_convex_hull_shape.html#a79a2ef9c53d7210ad1010f3b76311da4">ConvexHullShape::CollideSoftBodyVertices</a></code> where the wrong edge could be reported as the closest edge.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#ab3cd9f2562f0f051c032b3bc298d9604">PhysicsSystem::OptimizeBroadPhase</a></code>. When calling this function after removing all bodies from the <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html">PhysicsSystem</a></code>, the internal nodes would not be freed until bodies are added again. This could lead to running out of internal nodes in rare cases.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in <code><a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape.html">MeshShape</a></code> active edge calculation which could mark edges of non-manifold meshes as inactive instead of active.</li>
<li>Fixed passing underestimate of penetration depth in <code><a class="el" href="class_contact_listener.html#aa11e4d0107c2764e1c7e04eef72cb404">ContactListener::OnContactPersisted</a></code> when the contact comes from the contact cache.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_quad_tree.html">QuadTree</a></code> will now fall back to the heap when running out of stack space during collision queries. Previously this would trigger an assert and some collisions would not be detected.</li>
<li>Fixed <code><a class="el" href="class_body_interface.html#a511b9da7dae147b6d8d3227f30724334" title="Set velocity of body such that it will be positioned at inTargetPosition/Rotation in inDeltaTime seco...">BodyInterface::MoveKinematic</a></code>, <code>SetLinearVelocity</code>, <code>SetAngularVelocity</code>, <code>SetLinearAndAngularVelocity</code>, <code>AddLinearVelocity</code>, <code>AddLinearAndAngularVelocity</code>, <code>SetPositionRotationAndVelocity</code> and <code>SetMotionType</code> when body not added to the physics system yet.</li>
<li>Fixed UBSAN false positive error that detected a dirty trick in <code><a class="el" href="class_sim_shape_filter.html" title="Filter class used during the simulation (PhysicsSystem::Update) to filter out collisions at shape lev...">SimShapeFilter</a></code>.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_wheel_settings_t_v.html" title="WheelSettings object specifically for TrackedVehicleController.">WheelSettingsTV</a> and <a class="el" href="class_wheel_settings_w_v.html" title="WheelSettings object specifically for WheeledVehicleController.">WheelSettingsWV</a> were not serializing their base class members.</li>
<li>The remap tables in <code><a class="el" href="class_soft_body_shared_settings_1_1_optimization_results.html" title="Information about the optimization of the soft body, the indices of certain elements may have changed...">SoftBodySharedSettings::OptimizationResults</a></code> mapped from new to old index instead of from old to new as was documented. The maps now behave as documented.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where soft body bend constraints could be created with identical vertices. This led to an assert triggering.</li>
<li>Fixed infinite recursion when colliding a <code><a class="el" href="class_triangle_shape.html" title="A single triangle, not the most efficient way of creating a world filled with triangles but can be us...">TriangleShape</a></code> vs a <code><a class="el" href="class_triangle_shape.html" title="A single triangle, not the most efficient way of creating a world filled with triangles but can be us...">TriangleShape</a></code>.</li>
<li>32-bit MinGW g++ doesn't call the correct overload for the new operator when a type is 16 bytes aligned. This could cause unaligned read access violations.</li>
<li>Fixed compiling in double precision and fixed issues with floating point contraction that caused unit test failures on LoongArch architecture.</li>
<li>Added an epsilon to the <code>CastRay</code> / <code>CastShape</code> early out condition to avoid dividing by a very small number and overflowing to INF. This can cause a float overflow exception.</li>
<li>Fixed Samples requiring Vulkan extension <code>VK_EXT_device_address_binding_report</code> without checking if it is available.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan warning in Samples: VkSemaphore is being signaled by VkQueue but it may still be in use by VkSwapchainKHR.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect <a class="el" href="class_r_t_t_i.html">RTTI</a> definition of <code><a class="el" href="class_motorcycle_controller_settings.html">MotorcycleControllerSettings</a></code> which led to the members of <code><a class="el" href="class_wheeled_vehicle_controller_settings.html">WheeledVehicleControllerSettings</a></code> not being serialized.</li>
<li>Implemented missing <code><a class="el" href="class_vehicle_constraint.html#af953060386f731482956bb772840262c" title="Debug function to convert a constraint to its settings, note that this will not save to which bodies ...">VehicleConstraint::GetConstraintSettings</a></code> function.</li>
<li>Fixed colliding a compound shape vs a regular shape ignoring <code><a class="el" href="class_collide_shape_settings.html#a511c99470c2fe3b2e82d06ffe26c52c1">CollideShapeSettings::mMaxSeparationDistance</a></code>. This potentially led to missed collisions.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
v5.3.0</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a>
New functionality</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md52"></a>
Samples</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Samples and JoltViewer can run on Linux using Vulkan. Make sure to install the Vulkan SDK before compiling (see: <code>Build/ubuntu24_install_vulkan_sdk.sh</code>).</li>
<li>The Samples and JoltViewer can run on macOS using Metal.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a>
MeshShape</h3>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape.html">MeshShape</a></code>s of up to 110M triangles are possible now, but the actual maximum is very dependent on how the triangles in the mesh are connected.</li>
<li>Optimized creation of <code><a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape.html">MeshShape</a></code>. Improves build speed by about 25% and reduces number of allocations by a factor of 1000. Allocations caused contention when building meshes from multiple threads.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape_settings.html#ae0e76b7529df050688a104a1e35bf06e" title="Determines the quality of the tree building process.">MeshShapeSettings::mBuildQuality</a></code> which allows selecting between faster mesh creation or faster run time performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md54"></a>
Character</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>OnContactPersisted</code>, <code>OnContactRemoved</code>, <code>OnCharacterContactPersisted</code> and <code>OnCharacterContactRemoved</code> functions on <code><a class="el" href="class_character_contact_listener.html">CharacterContactListener</a></code> to better match the interface of <code><a class="el" href="class_contact_listener.html">ContactListener</a></code>.</li>
<li>Every <code><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a></code> now has a <code><a class="el" href="class_character_i_d.html" title="ID of a character. Used primarily to identify deleted characters and to sort deterministically.">CharacterID</a></code>. This ID can be used to identify the character after removal and is used to make the simulation deterministic in case a character collides with multiple other virtual characters.</li>
<li>Added support for <code><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a></code> to override the inner rigid body ID. This can be used to make the simulation deterministic in e.g. client/server setups.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md55"></a>
Collision Detection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#aa5e3d3dc2758b0ca0bcb6eb8e77bd379">PhysicsSystem::SetSimShapeFilter</a></code>. This allows filtering out collisions between sub shapes within a body and can for example be used to have a single body that contains a low detail simulation shape an a high detail collision query shape. An example of a body that's both a sensor and a rigid body can be found in <code>ContactListenerTest</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#aa20737fdf1b3deb79a4b8da27ef42572">PhysicsSystem::SetSimCollideBodyVsBody</a></code>. This allows overriding the collision detection between two bodies. It can be used to only store the 1st hit for sensor collisions. This makes sensors cheaper if you only need to know if there is an overlap or not. An example can be found in <code>SimCollideBodyVsBodyTest</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_closest_hit_per_body_collision_collector.html" title="Implementation that collects the closest / deepest hit for each body and optionally sorts them on dis...">ClosestHitPerBodyCollisionCollector</a></code> which will report the closest / deepest hit per body that the collision query collides with.</li>
<li>Added overridable <code><a class="el" href="class_collision_collector.html#ae5d038bd6a96af9c55fb49623fbd31ba" title="When running a query through the NarrowPhaseQuery class, this will be called after all AddHit calls h...">CollisionCollector::OnBodyEnd</a></code> that is called after all hits for a body have been processed when collecting hits through <code><a class="el" href="class_narrow_phase_query.html">NarrowPhaseQuery</a></code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
New Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for RISC-V, LoongArch and PowerPC (Little Endian) CPUs.</li>
<li>Added support for WASM64.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Various</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed the use of <code>std::unordered_map</code> and <code>std::unordered_set</code> and replaced them with our own implementation: <code><a class="el" href="class_unordered_map.html">UnorderedMap</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="class_unordered_set.html">UnorderedSet</a></code>.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_motion_properties.html#a0c437b5479bd58417b50be0da6b852f7">MotionProperties::ScaleToMass</a></code>. This lets you easily change the mass and inertia tensor of a body after creation.</li>
<li>Split up <code><a class="el" href="class_body.html#a7797f43ac6078b682b4c9cb6c7b9b18e">Body::ApplyBuoyancyImpulse</a></code> into <code><a class="el" href="class_body.html#a6f626cfeebe957b45503d752a5052f75">Body::GetSubmergedVolume</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="class_body.html#a7797f43ac6078b682b4c9cb6c7b9b18e">Body::ApplyBuoyancyImpulse</a></code>. This allows you to use the calculated submerged volume for other purposes.</li>
<li>Added binary serialization to <code><a class="el" href="class_skeletal_animation.html" title="Resource for a skinned animation.">SkeletalAnimation</a></code>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to add a sub shape at a specified index in a <code><a class="el" href="class_mutable_compound_shape.html">MutableCompoundShape</a></code> rather than at the end.</li>
<li>Added <code><a class="el" href="class_s_t_l_local_allocator.html" title="STL allocator that keeps N elements in a local buffer before falling back to regular allocations.">STLLocalAllocator</a></code> which is an allocator that can be used in e.g. the <code><a class="el" href="class_array.html">Array</a></code> class. It keeps a fixed size buffer for N elements and only when it runs out of space falls back to the heap.</li>
<li>Added the following constants on <a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html">PhysicsSystem</a>: <code>cMaxBodiesLimit</code>, <code>cMaxBodyPairsLimit</code> and <code>cMaxContactConstraintsLimit</code>. These constants are the max allowable values for <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#ae578fcd0c58f678156b7cd8b44f811a6">PhysicsSystem::Init</a></code>. Exceeding these will trigger an assert and the system will clamp the values. Note that on a 32 bit system, you'll run out of memory before you reach these values.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bodies gaining more energy than intended due to restitution. E.g. A restitution of 1 could lead to bodies bouncing ever higher.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_body_interface.html#a9ecde691e54928413bc001db60830488" title="See Body::AddForce.">BodyInterface::AddForce</a></code> applied a force per soft body vertex rather than to the whole body, this resulted in a soft body accelerating much more compared to a rigid body of the same mass.</li>
<li><code>std::push_heap</code>/<code>pop_heap</code> behave differently on macOS vs Windows/Linux when elements compare equal, this made the cross platform deterministic build not deterministic in some cases.</li>
<li>Removing a sub shape from a <code><a class="el" href="class_mutable_compound_shape.html">MutableCompoundShape</a></code> would not update the bounding box if the last shape was removed, which can result in a small performance loss.</li>
<li>An empty <code><a class="el" href="class_mutable_compound_shape.html">MutableCompoundShape</a></code> now returns the same local bounding box as <code><a class="el" href="class_empty_shape.html">EmptyShape</a></code> (a point at (0, 0, 0)). This prevents floating point overflow exceptions.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_vehicle_constraint.html">VehicleConstraint</a> would override <code><a class="el" href="class_body.html#a4fcb04dbca94ff4cf4b48289f26c26b4">Body::SetAllowSleeping</a></code> every frame, making it impossible for client code to configure a vehicle that cannot go to sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed <code><a class="el" href="struct_character_virtual_1_1_contact.html#ae19592c8bdfb0e4fc0b22b88e12f3ebd" title="If B is a sensor.">CharacterVirtual::Contact::mIsSensorB</a></code> not being persisted in <code>SaveState</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>CharacterVirtual::Contact::mHadContact</code> not being true for collisions with sensors. They will still be marked as <code>mWasDiscarded</code> to prevent any further interaction.</li>
<li>Fixed <code><a class="el" href="class_character.html#a15f5407b7ccbe01588462989a4e0cfda">Character::SetShape</a></code> failing to switch when standing inside a sensor / <code><a class="el" href="class_character.html#a6fd02888e30d3a718e81680857ca3968">Character::PostSimulation</a></code> finding a sensor as ground collision.</li>
<li>Fixed numerical inaccuracy in penetration depth calculation when <code><a class="el" href="class_collide_shape_settings.html#a511c99470c2fe3b2e82d06ffe26c52c1">CollideShapeSettings::mMaxSeparationDistance</a></code> was set to a really high value (e.g. 1000).</li>
<li>Bugfix in <code><a class="el" href="class_semaphore.html#a81c1cbdab78310c8b13e7052572e599d" title="Acquire the semaphore inNumber times.">Semaphore::Acquire</a></code> for non-windows platform. The count was updated before waiting, meaning that the counter would become -(number of waiting threads) and the semaphore would not wake up until at least the same amount of releases was done. In practice this meant that the main thread had to do the last (number of threads) jobs, slowing down the simulation a bit.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in <code>ManifoldBetweenTwoFaces</code> that led to incorrect <code><a class="el" href="class_contact_manifold.html#a82c0a5937e977e8ce4169d39e1a3d64c" title="Contact points on the surface of shape 2 relative to mBaseOffset. If there&#39;s no penetration,...">ContactManifold::mRelativeContactPointsOn2</a></code> when the contact normal and the face normal were not roughly parallel. Also it possibly led to jitter in the simulation in that case.</li>
<li>Fixed <code><a class="el" href="class_internal_edge_removing_collector.html">InternalEdgeRemovingCollector</a></code> not working when colliding with a very dense triangle grid because it ran out of internal space. Now falling back to memory allocations when this happens to avoid ghost collisions.</li>
<li>Fixed running out of stack space when simulating a really high number of active rigid bodies.</li>
<li>Moved the 'broad phase bit' to the highest bit in <code><a class="el" href="class_body_i_d.html" title="ID of a body. This is a way of reasoning about bodies in a multithreaded simulation while avoiding ra...">BodyID</a></code> to avoid running out of <code>NodeID</code>s in <code><a class="el" href="class_broad_phase_quad_tree.html" title="Fast SIMD based quad tree BroadPhase that is multithreading aware and tries to do a minimal amount of...">BroadPhaseQuadTree</a></code> when calling <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#ab3cd9f2562f0f051c032b3bc298d9604">PhysicsSystem::OptimizeBroadPhase</a></code> on a tree with a very high body count.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="class_temp_allocator_impl.html" title="Default implementation of the temp allocator that allocates a large block through malloc upfront.">TempAllocatorImpl</a></code> uses 64 bit integers internally to allow for a higher max contact constraint count.</li>
<li>When inserting lots of bodies without using batching, a broad phase tree of depth &gt; 128 can be created. If the <code><a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html">PhysicsSystem</a></code> was destructed in this situation, a stack overflow would cause a crash.</li>

It should only be turned off if both are.</li>
<li>Fixed <code><a class="el" href="class_cylinder_shape.html#aa2ef3b2d1a7889c6a55d868ac8549280">CylinderShape::GetSupportingFace</a></code> returning the wrong face. When the height of a cylinder was small compared to its radius, it would sink more into the ground than needed during simulation.</li>
<li>When there were no active bodies, the step listeners weren't called. This meant they couldn't wake up bodies. The step listeners are now only skipped if the physics system is updated with zero delta time.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition in soft body simulation that could break determinism.</li>
<li>Added overloads for placement new in the <code>JPH_OVERRIDE_NEW_DELETE</code> macro, this means it is no longer needed to do <code>:: new (address) JPH::class_name(constructor_arguments)</code> but you can do <code>new (address) JPH::class_name(constructor_arguments)</code>.</li>

Soft Body</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added soft body skinning constraints. This can be used to limit the movement of soft body vertices based on a skinned mesh. See <a href="https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysics/index.html#skinning-soft-bodies">documentation</a> for more info or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXw8yMczHJg">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added ability to turn on/off skinning constraints and to update the max distance for all constraints with a distance multiplier.</li>
<li>Added dihedral bend constraints for soft bodies. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iswelnGH4">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added long range attachment constraints (also called tethers) for soft bodies.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_soft_body_contact_listener.html">SoftBodyContactListener</a> which allows you to get callbacks for collisions between soft bodies and rigid bodies. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmS_8d2bdOw">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for a vertex radius for soft bodies. This keeps the vertices a fixed distance away from the surface which can be used to avoid z-fighting while rendering the soft body.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_soft_body_shared_settings.html#a9880c4cadc96bb24402b3cf3021aff2b">SoftBodySharedSettings::CreateConstraints</a> function that can automatically generate constraints based on the faces of the soft body.</li>

This is e.g. useful if the soft body is teleported and needs to 'settle'.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md73"></a>
Vehicles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for less than 1 collision test per simulation step for vehicle wheels. This behavior can be configured differently when the vehicle is active / inactive. This can be used for LODding vehicles.</li>
<li>Added wheel index to <a class="el" href="class_vehicle_constraint.html#a98e6b9822af90bf4d3a513d04acd5bc8">VehicleConstraint::CombineFunction</a> friction callback and calculating longitudinal and lateral friction in the same call so you can have more differentiation between wheels.</li>

<li>Added ability to disable the lean steering limit for the motorcycle, turning this off makes the motorcycle more unstable, but gives you more control over the final steering angle.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md74"></a>
Character</h3>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a> will now receive an OnContactAdded callback when it collides with a sensor (but will have no further interaction).</li>

</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Swing limits do not need to be symmetrical anymore for SixDOFConstraints. This requires using the new pyramid shaped swing limits (<a class="el" href="_swing_twist_constraint_part_8h.html#add9e89df628b33308461ef46e1b796b6a5e5b0d93bab61584149905b5e5dc71a0" title="Swing is limited by a pyramid shape, note that this pyramid starts to deform for larger swing angles.">ESwingType::Pyramid</a>). SwingTwistConstraints still requires symmetrical limits but can use the pyramid swing limits too. These are cheaper to evaluate but are less smooth.</li>
<li>Twist limits no longer need to be centered around zero for SixDOFConstraints and SwingTwistConstraints, any value between -PI and PI is supported now.</li>
<li>Changed the meaning of Constraint::mNumVelocity/PositionStepsOverride. Before the number of steps would be the maximum of all constraints and the default value, now an overridden value of 0 means that the constraint uses the default value, otherwise it will use the value as specified. This means that if all constraints in an island have a lower value than the default, we will now use the lower value instead of the default. This allows simulating an island at a lower precision than the default.</li>
<li>Bodies can now also override the default number of solver iterations. This value is used when the body collides with another body and a contact constraint is created (for constraints, the constraint override is always used).</li>
<li>Added fraction hint to <a class="el" href="class_path_constraint_path.html#aa84329614fd89561c555e2af0d4381a2">PathConstraintPath::GetClosestPoint</a>. This can be used to speed up the search along the curve and to disambiguate fractions in case a path reaches the same point multiple times (i.e. a figure-8).</li>

It can be used after calling SetPose to reset ...">Ragdoll::ResetWarmStart</a>. Used to notify the system that the configuration of the bodies and/or constraint has changed enough so that the warm start impulses should not be applied the next frame. You can use this function for example when repositioning a ragdoll through <a class="el" href="class_ragdoll.html#a535e76f7fb7bfee484d82570a3066ae7" title="Set the ragdoll to a pose (calls BodyInterface::SetPositionAndRotation to instantly move the ragdoll)">Ragdoll::SetPose</a> in such a way that the orientation of the bodies completely changes so that the previous frame impulses are no longer a good approximation of what the impulses will be in the next frame.</li>
<li>Multithreading the SetupVelocityConstraints job. This was causing a bottleneck in the case that there are a lot of constraints but very few possible collisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md76"></a>

<li>Renamed SensorDetectsStatic to CollideKinematicVsNonDynamic and made it work for non-sensors. This means that kinematic bodies can now get collision callbacks when they collide with other static / kinematic objects.</li>
<li>Added function to query the bounding box of all bodies in the physics system, see <a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#a7f87f05d94f62054d6f3e975b613d2f0" title="Get the bounding box of all bodies in the physics system.">PhysicsSystem::GetBounds</a>.</li>

<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_debug_renderer_simple.html">DebugRendererSimple</a> which can be used to simplify the creation of your own <a class="el" href="class_debug_renderer.html">DebugRenderer</a> implementation. It only requires a DrawLine, DrawTriangle and DrawText3D function to be implemented (which can be left empty).</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md79"></a>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md80"></a>
Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in cast sphere vs triangle that could return a false positive hit against a degenerate triangle.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in soft body vs tapered capsule. The calculations were slightly off causing a normal on the top or bottom sphere to be returned while the tapered part was actually closest.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where colliding a cyclinder against a large triangle could return an incorrect contact point.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where soft bodies would collide with sensors as if they were normal bodies.</li>
<li>Sensors will no longer use speculative contacts, so will no longer report contacts before an actual contact is detected.</li>
<li>Hinge limit constraint forces were clamped wrongly when the hinge was exactly at the minimum limit, making it harder to push the hinge towards the maximum limit.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when a body with limited DOFs collides with static. If the resulting contact had an infinite effective mass, we would divide by zero and crash.</li>
<li>Fixed unit tests failing when compiling for 32-bit Linux. The compiler defaults to using x87 instructions in this case which does not work well with the collision detection pipeline. Now defaulting to the SSE instructions.</li>
<li>Fixed assert and improved interaction between a fast moving rigid body of quality LinearCast and a soft body.</li>
<li>When creating a <a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape.html">MeshShape</a> with triangles that have near identical positions it was possible that the degenerate check decided that a triangle was not degenerate while the triangle in fact would be degenerate after vertex quantization. The simulation would crash when colliding with this triangle.</li>
<li>A scaled compound shape with a center of mass of non zero would not apply the correct transform to its sub shapes when colliding with a soft body</li>
<li>A soft body without any edges would hang the solver</li>
<li>Fixed GCC 11.4 warning in <a class="el" href="_job_system_thread_pool_8cpp.html">JobSystemThreadPool.cpp</a>: output may be truncated copying 15 bytes from a string of length 63</li>
<li>Longitudinal friction impulse for wheeled/tracked vehicles could become much higher than the calculated max because each iteration it was clamped to the max friction impulse which meant the total friction impulse could be <a class="el" href="struct_physics_settings.html#a66af679ba7f202b402bb23d0a0e117ad">PhysicsSettings::mNumVelocitySteps</a> times too high.</li>
<li>Properly initializing current engine RPM to min RPM for wheeled/tracked vehicles. When min RPM was lower than the default min RPM the engine would not start at min RPM.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible division by zero in <a class="el" href="class_body.html#aad1ce1d84e95cab008fb239465b3496f" title="Debug function to convert a body back to a body creation settings object to be able to save/recreate ...">Body::GetBodyCreationSettings</a> when the inverse inertia diagonal had 0's.</li>
<li>When specifying a -1 for min/max distance of a distance constraint and the calculated distance is incompatible with the other limit, we'll clamp it to that value now instead of ending up with min &gt; max.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that contact cache was partially uninitialized when colliding two objects with inv mass override of 0. When the contact listener would report a non zero inv mass override the next simulation step this would mean that the simulation would read garbage and potentially crash due to NaNs.</li>

<li>If a body is removed between the broad phase detecting an overlap and the narrow phase locking the body, callbacks could be called on a body that has already been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed flipped normals in EPA penetration depth algorithm which could cause the normal to point in the wrong direction for collision tests.</li>
<li>Respecting the IsSensor flag for CCD bodies.</li>
<li>Fixed double locking issue that could cause a deadlock while updating the AABB of a body during simulation.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when fetching a body using an invalid <a class="el" href="class_body_i_d.html" title="ID of a body. This is a way of reasoning about bodies in a multithreaded simulation while avoiding ra...">BodyID</a>.</li>
<li>Windows 32 vs 64-bit versions produce the same deterministic results now.</li>
<li>Heightfield vs convex was not filled in in collision dispatch table. This caused sensors to assert and not detect collisions with heightfields.</li>
<li>The friction applied during continuous collision detection could be sqrt(2) times too large.</li>
<li>The friction was clamped independently on both tangential axis which meant that the total friction could be larger than the amount of friction that should have been allowed. It also meant that an object would slow down quicker on one axis than on another causing a curved trajectory.</li>
